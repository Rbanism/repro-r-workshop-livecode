The following checklist can be used to assess the level of reproducibility of your project.

## Documentation
- [ ] Is there a README file that indicates
  - [ ] the purpose of the project, 
  - [ ] who to contact with questions, 
  - [ ] a map of the directory structure, and 
  - [ ] a description of what software and hardware is needed to reproduce your workflow?
- [ ] Are there README files in each folder describing the contents of the folder, how they were acquired/generated?
- [ ] Is there a CITATION file that tells users how to site the project, data, and code?
- [ ] Does the project have a LICENSE file?
- [ ] Is the project's repository publicly available?

## Data
- [ ] Is the data included or linked, with instructions on how to obtain the data?
- [ ] If data is not included, is this because it is not necessary or generated as part of the project?
- [ ] Are your raw data (if any) and processed data files separated?
- [ ] If data is not open:
  - [ ] Is it accessible via a protocol?
  - [ ] Is there synthetic data provided so the project can be run?
- [ ] Is citation information available for the data?
- [ ] Does the data use open formats, such as CSV and TXT?

## Software
- [ ] Is there a list of dependencies? 
- [ ] Is a container available to run the project?
- [ ] Are version number of every external application used in the process?
- [ ] Does your project use only open software?

## Workflow and automation
- [ ] Is the workflow clearly documented (with or without code)?
- [ ] Is your workflow scripted, i.e., using code? 
- [ ] Is your code well documented?
- [ ] Is your code modular, i.e., does it use functions?
- [ ] Are unit tests available for the code?
- [ ] Does your repository make use of continuous integration tools to insure internal reproduciblity?

## Organization
- [ ] Are all data, code, results, and documentation housed within a monophyletic folder structure?
- [ ] Is your project folder structured to separate your data, code, documentation, and results?
- [ ] Can the project be run from the project's root folder?
- [ ] Is the project under version control?
- [ ] Do files use a consistent naming scheme that indicates what they contain?

## Publication
- [ ] Are papers and reports from the project generated using literate programming tools so that results are not hard-coded?
- [ ] Does the project have a persistent identifier?

This list was inspired by the more extensive [Checklist Questions to stimulate thought about a Project's Reproducibility](https://github.com/datacarpentry/rr-intro/blob/gh-pages/checklist.md) 
which we recommend you consider for making your work reproducible.
